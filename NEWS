* Version 2.1.2 (May 19, 2021)

  - Fix empty strings.

  - Remove all uses of #nil.


* Version 2.1.1 (May 19, 2021)

  - Fix build with Guile 3.0.7.


* Version 2.1.0 (Feb 24, 2021)

  - Add Redis 6.2.0 commands.


* Version 2.0.0 (Nov 16, 2020)

  - Add Redis 6.0.0 commands.

  - Fix support for Redis Pub/Sub. Before guile-redis 2.0.0, publish,
    subscribe & co. commands were treated as the rest of Redis
    commands. However, these commands are special and are now implemented as
    separate procedures.
    (Fixes #3)


* Version 1.3.0 (Jan 26, 2019)

  - Added more redis 5.0.0 commands: (cluster replicas), (client id), (client
    unblock), (replicaof), (xack), (xgroup), (xinfo), (xtrim), (xdel),
    (xclaim).


* Version 1.2.0 (Sep 24, 2018)

  - All command arguments (if any) are now passed as a single list. With this
    change, there's no need to use strings for every argument.


* Version 1.1.0 (Aug 22, 2018)

  - Switch to GPLv3.


* Version 1.0.0 (Aug 8, 2018)

  - This version is not backwards compatible with the initial release
    0.1.0. The main change is that now all commands follow the
    specification defined by redis. All the arguments are now given as
    strings, this is because the commands are automatically
    generated. Before the commands were manually added which made it
    very hard to keep the library up-to-date plus each command would
    have its own procedure signature. The disadvantge of this approach
    is that the commands are less idiomatic, but the big benefit is
    that adding new commands is as simple as adding a new line with
    the command name.

    The idea of autogenerating the commands was taken from the chicken
    scheme redis-client implementation, thanks!


* Version 0.1.0 (Jul 14, 2013)

  Initial release.
